        <h2>My Bio</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area, and I have lived a pretty fantastic life to date. I went to UC Davis for my undergrad, I recently finished my MBA at Golden Gate University, I am very close with my family, I am a Co-Owner of a small property management company called <a href="http://www.rockheadandquarry.com">Rockhead and Quarry LLC</a>, and I am very excited to learn about how to be a quality programmer.</p>

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>When I was much younger, I used basic HTML to create websites on Yahoo's GeoCities; typically the websites were dedicated walkthroughs of some video game I had recently mastered. Later, I became a relatively well-known custom map creater on Blizzard's StarCraft, and those maps would essentially be stand-alone games; with thousands of unique triggers and basic code mixed in. All of this came rushing back to me recently, and so I decided to start spending some time reintroducing myself to basic programming.<br><br>Using free sites like Khan Academy, I quickly ran through all the lessons in SQL, HTML, and I started with CSS. I was loving every minute of it, and the hours were flying by. That's when I decided I wanted to refocus myself, join an academic program to learn these technical skills I covet, and ultimately take on a job I am truly passionate about.<br><br>Additionally, I play ultimate frisbee competitively, I enjoy playing various racket sports (tennis, racquetball, badminton, etc.), I love spending time out on the water (windsurfing, sailing, etc.), and I passionately follow several Bay Area professional sports teams: The 49ers, Giants, and Warriors.<br><br>I like meeting new people, making friends, and taking on exciting new challenges. I'm hoping this program at GA will help me accomplish those goals, while pushing me to learn new technical skills I covet.</p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>Programming is something that has always been interesting to me, but until recently I never had the courage to just go for it. I instead elected for the safety of working in human resources; something I knew I was good at. But even in those positions, my natural talent and proclivity would lead me to become the manager of the HRMS/HCM/ATS systems, and also to be the go-to IT troubleshooter.</p>
